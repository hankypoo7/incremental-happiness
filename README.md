Incremental game about mental health. Can you get your stress levels down to zero, or will you burn out trying?

### [- play the game here -](https://heuperman.github.io/incremental-health/)

## Project goals

The main intention for this project was to have an enjoyable way to get myself more familiar with TypeScript and the Angular framework. It was built using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and styled using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/). [fxLayoutAlign](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/fxLayoutAlign-API) was used for the responsive layout and the GitHub pages branch was published using [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages).  

## Setup

First clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/heuperman/incremental-health.git`  
Then install the required dependencies: `npm install`

## Running the app in developer mode

Type `npm run start` to spin up a dev server.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the game in action.  
The game will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.  

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.  
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/incremental-health` directory.  
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Making changes

To make minor changes e.g. adjust upgrade costs or production rates simply change the numbers in the relevant field.  
If you want to make more substantial changes to the game I recommend reading up on [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) first. 
Remember that any changes could cause conflicts with game data saved in localStorage.

### Thanks for playing!
